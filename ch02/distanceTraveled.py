# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the inter-
# state can be calculated with the following formula:
# Distance = Speed x Time
# A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
# • The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# • The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

SPEED = 70

print(f"The distance the car will travel in 6 hours: {SPEED * 6}m")
print(f"The distance the car will travel in 10 hours: {SPEED * 10}m")
print(f"The distance the car will travel in 15 hours: {SPEED * 15}m")
